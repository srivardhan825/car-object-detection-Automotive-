🧾 Explanation (What this code does)
 
Step	                              Function
1️⃣	                   Loads Faster R-CNN pre-trained model from torchvision
2️⃣	                   Reads each frame of the input video using OpenCV
3️⃣                    Detects vehicles and draws bounding boxes
4️⃣	                   Tracks the movement of each vehicle across frames
5️⃣	                   Calculates speed (based on frame difference × FPS × scale)
6️⃣                    Displays the vehicle speed live on the video feed
